This repository demonstrates an uncommon ActionScript 3 error related to calling a possibly undefined method. The error arises when trying to access or call a method on a variable that might not be properly initialized or might not have the method defined. The solution involves checking for the existence of the method before calling it or ensuring the variable is correctly initialized.  This example highlights the importance of robust variable handling and null checks in ActionScript 3 development.
